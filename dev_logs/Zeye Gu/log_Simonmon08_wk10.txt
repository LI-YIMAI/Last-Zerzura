Devlog-week10:  Coded projectile functionality this week 


1.Update bullets config info for all towers, 

2.Create Shoot() in Tower.cs. This function makes sure each tower can get a projectile and the projectile can be easily replaced for further development. 

3.Setup attack cool down and attack speed for the towers. 

4.Make MoveToTarget() so that bullet can move towards the target monster with a certain speed. 

5.Connect attacking animations to the towers and add attck trigger so that when there is a target monster in the range of a tower the attacking animation will start working.
