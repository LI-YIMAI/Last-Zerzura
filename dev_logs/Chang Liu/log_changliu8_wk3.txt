working together for the Singleton design pattern and Facade Design pattern  

Implement Singleton script which inheritance from the external unity API MonoBehaviour.  

Make LevelManager, GameManager, and Hover script inheritance from Singleton<T> where T represent the type of itself. The other class or script can access the properties or functions straightforward by calling the instance attribute in Singleton  

Implement Facade script which is the GameManager we have. It provides a simplified interface to control other classes(scripts) and UI component in unity. It is designed to control the game functionalities such spawning wave of monster, pick/buy tower, quit game, reload game, and restart, etc.
