###  Project Discription
The project is a 2D tower defense game based on unity. The user interface provides the
functionalities which include Map selection menu, game level selection, setting button,
and detailed tutorials which can improve the game experience for users. In the game
interface, there is a button that can be clicked, and a menu will be popped up. It can
provide the functionalities of restart, pause, and quit the game for users. There are three
maps provided for the user. The main feature of the map is the fog of war. Users can
detect more vision by placing the tower. It can strengthen the interaction between user
and gaming behavior. There are four towers for users and one of them is called scout
tower which can bring more vison to the map. The other three towers are designed for
attacking minions. Each tower has associated gold and the user must build the tower
through the game store with their gold. The tower can be upgraded by the user with more
gold. The gold can be earned through killing minions. Also, the tower could be sold by
the users.
